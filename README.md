# Ovid

An editor specifically for writing fiction novels.

It's a work in progress.

    pythom -m venv venv
    source venv/build/activate
    pip install PyQt6
    ./script/ovid

If you wish to do some development, you'll want to install pytest locally so
it can pick up the right files.

    pip install pytest
    deactivate & source venv/bin/activate # this loads pytest from venv

It doesn't do much yet, so please feel free to ignore.
